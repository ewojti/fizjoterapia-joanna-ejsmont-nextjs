# Fizjoterapia Joanna with blog

# https://www.fizjoterapia-ejsmont.pl/

This is a repository for a website project for a physiotherapy business, which also includes a blog with a Hygraph CMS integration. The website was initially written in Create React App, but it has been migrated to Next.js due to several reasons. One of the main advantages of Next.js is that it provides easy image and font optimization, which can significantly improve the website's loading speed and overall performance. In addition to this, Next.js also offers several other benefits, such as built-in server-side rendering, automatic code splitting, and better SEO optimization capabilities. By leveraging these features, the website can provide a better user experience and achieve better search engine rankings.
